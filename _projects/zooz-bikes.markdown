  text: 'We developed a custom display font: Zooz Sans. It uses a modular system to
    structure the mechanical forms. This is balanced with an oblique slant and sharp
    angles to give it a speedy feel.'

    Previous models were only available in chrome, so we worked together to develop
    a range of striking new colors & graphics for the latest bikes.

Zooz needed to build their brand before they launched their flagship product, The Urban Ultralight. We developed a set of visuals that felt as fun as the bikes. The system was used to launch their social channels and ecommerce, resulting in massive interest that caused Zooz to double their initial pre-order of bikes.
