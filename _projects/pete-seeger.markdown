Pete Seeger is an icon of American folk music. Smithsonian Folkways wanted to commemorate Seeger's 100th birthday by releasing the most comprehensive collection of his work. The project consists of six CDs and a 200 page book detailing Seeger's history—from first performing with Woody Guthrie, to being blacklisted by Joseph McCarthy, to playing at Barack Obama’s inauguration.
