This site uses a couple of cookies to keep it running smoothly.

The site uses Google Analytics. Google Analytics cookies helps to distinguish between different users and understand how often a particular user visits the site, how the user got to the site, and the user’s activity on the site.  Google developed two resources – [How Google Uses Information from Sites or Apps that Use Our Services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) and [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) – to help provide website visitors more information and choice on how their data is collected when websites use Google services.

The fancy dark-mode effect relies on a cookie to remember your settings when you change pages or leave the site.
